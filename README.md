# JOINT SAVINGS


## OVERVIEW

When people think of Blockchain, the first thing that comes to mind is Cryptocurrency. While Cryptocurrencies are an integral part of Blockchain technology, there are a plethora of other elements that have the opportunity to revolutionize the systems within the financial sector, and the interaction of the consumer with these systems. Chief among them are Smart Contracts. A Smart Contract is a script that automates the actions specific to a contract between two parties. Smart contracts do not contain any legal language, terms, or agreements; they are comprised exclusively of code that only execute when specified conditions are met. This comprehensive project will use the power of the Solidity programming language to create an Ethereum Smart Contract. This blockchain program will allow financial institutions to automate their processes and features using Smart Contracts: In this instance it will be used to host joint savings accounts. The following objectives will be accomplished:

1. Creation of a Joint Savings Account using Solidity.

2. The compilation and deployment of the Smart Contract will be done using Remix VM (London), formerly JavaScript VM.

3. Interaction and deployment of the Smart Contract.


## TECHNOLOGIES

The installation requirements for this code are as follows:

[SOLIDITY](https://soliditylang.org/) - Enables the user to use the powerful Solidity programming language to develop Smart Contracts.

[REMIX](https://remix.ethereum.org/) OR [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Access to the VSCode IDE or the web-based IDE, Remix, to develop this Solidity-based code and document. Remix will be needed to compile and deploy the contract.



## USAGE

For the functionality of the joint_savings.sol code, the following compiler and environment, respectively, must be active:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
Remix VM (London)
```

For the functionality of the deployment of the joint_savings colde, credentials must be input in the following features:

```solidity
